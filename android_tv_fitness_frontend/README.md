# Android TV Fitness Frontend (Placeholder)

This is a temporary scaffold to unblock CI. A minimal Gradle wrapper shim is provided.

- Primary: `./gradlew check` (no-op) — if executable permissions are not preserved in CI, use:
- Fallback: `sh run-gradle.sh check`

Replace these placeholders with a full Android project during frontend implementation.
