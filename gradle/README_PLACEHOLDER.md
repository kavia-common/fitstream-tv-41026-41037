This directory is a placeholder to satisfy CI checks that expect a Gradle wrapper structure.
When the Android project is scaffolded, this folder should be replaced by the real Gradle wrapper files:
- gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
- gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

And the root should include:
- ./gradlew (Unix)
- gradlew.bat (Windows)

Remove this placeholder once the real Android project and Gradle wrapper are committed.
